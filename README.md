## Overview

The world is rich with biodiversity, but much of it goes unnoticed and undocumented. Our web app, Global Biodiversity Mapper, lets users crowdsource sightings of birds, insects, and plants using photo ID with AI, seasonal heatmaps, and species and area requests (possibly by researchers). It promotes citizen science, supports research, and raises awareness of urban ecology through interactive, gamified exploration. Technology shouldn't be about disconnecting with the physical world, but about promoting connection, and living in harmony with it. This app will empower citizens to be involved with the environment on a sensory level, and engage with scientists and researchers to see their involvement directly contribute to the improvement of their land.
